# cmpu250-project-group-1: IMDb Data, Review Bombing, and Score Weighting

Our project focuses on movie reviews, the phenomenon and impacts of review bombing, and IMDb's score weighting. We sought to understand what movies get review bombed based on their content and cast demographics, how review bombing may impact a film's chances of being recommended, and whether/how score weighting counteracts this. 

Our dataset was scraped from the IMDb website; we added several metrics ourselves, including polarization, and also combined IMDb's cast data with datasets relating to cast race/ethnicity and gender to assess the potential effects of cast demographics on review bombing. Because IMDb's content is user-submitted, someone seeking to recreate our dataset at this moment would achieve slightly different results due to all the ratings added to IMDb in the interim period. However, the scripts we used are available in the "scripts" directory of our repository, and the datasets, both original and cleaned, are in the "data" repository and can be viewed and used as we used them.

Our initial proposal, exploratory data analysis, and preliminary and final reports, as well as our peer review work, appear in the appropriate directories. All of the figures that appear in our reports are available in the project.ipynb file in the main repository and/or the eda.ipynb file in the EDA directory, and should be easily replicated using our dataset and code. 

The README in the data directory contains a codebook and descriptions of the relevant data for those interested in recreating or expanding on our work. This includes data on box office revenues and international polarization which we cultivated and cleaned but did not end up using in our analysis.

Thank you for reading!
